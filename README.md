## Description
This code challenge consists of three questions, each with a problem that has its own solutions.

# Q1. SwapCase Function
This is a javascript function that takes a string as input and swaps the case of each character. It splits the string into an array of characters then iterates through each character in the array converting uppercase letters to lowercase and vice versa, and finally joins the characters back into a string. In question 1 we write a function that accepts a string as input and swaps the case of each character. For example if you input 'The Quick Brown Fox' the output should be 'tHE qUICK bROWN fOX'.

# Q2. Array Generator Function
This function takes two numbers as input and generates the array of numbers between them. In this this challenge we use an array generator that accepts two numbers to generate an array between them. For example, if the two numbers are 4 and 7, the output should be [4, 5, 6, 7] and -4 and 7 should return [-4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7].

# Q3. Prime Number Generator
This is a javascript function that takes an array of numbers as input and returns a new array containing only the prime numbers of from the original array in the same order as they appear in the input array. The function accurately identifies prime numbers and returns them in the same order they appear in the input array. For example an array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] should return an array [2, 3, 5, 7].
